# AI-Company-Internal-Chatbot-with-Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-

AI Company Internal Chatbot with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

This project implements a secure, enterprise-focused internal AI chatbot that enables employees to query company documents using natural language while strictly enforcing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The system integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure responses are accurate, context-aware, and derived only from authorized data sources.

The solution is designed for organizations where data privacy, compliance, and controlled access are critical. Each document is processed, chunked, embedded, and tagged with role-based metadata, ensuring users retrieve only the information permitted by their assigned role.

🔐 Core Objectives

Enable secure natural language access to internal knowledge

Enforce strict department-wise data isolation

Prevent unauthorized document retrieval at the database level

Use open-source and free tools for cost-effective deployment
